`doorkeeper-sequel` provides [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper) support to [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) database toolkit.

## Requirements

* Doorkeeper >= 4.0
* Rails >= 4.2 (Doorkeeper 4 dropped support of lower versions)
* Sequel >= 4

## Installation

To start using the Doorkeeper Sequel ORM, add to your Gemfile:

``` ruby
# For Doorkeeper 4.x
gem 'doorkeeper', '~> 4.3'
gem 'doorkeeper-sequel', '~> 1.5'

# For Doorkeeper 5.x
gem 'doorkeeper', '~> 5.0'
gem 'doorkeeper-sequel', '~> 2.0'
```

Or you can use git `master` branch for the latest gem version:
  
``` ruby
gem 'doorkeeper-sequel', git: 'https://github.com/nbulaj/doorkeeper-sequel.git'
```

Set the Doorkeeper ORM configuration:

``` ruby
Doorkeeper.configure do
  orm :sequel
end
```

Generate migrations:

```
rake doorkeeper_sequel:generate:migration
rake doorkeeper_sequel:generate:application_owner
rake doorkeeper_sequel:generate:previous_refresh_token
rake doorkeeper_sequel:generate:confidential_applications # for Doorkeeper >= 4.4
```

## Tests

To run tests, clone this repository and run `rake`. It will copy and run `Doorkeeper`’s original test suite after configuring the ORM and other stuffs.

```
$ bundle exec rake
```
